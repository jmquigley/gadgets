This library provides widgets and composite controls for building desktop apps using electron.  The available controls are listed below.

## Requirements

- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) v1.7+
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v7.8+
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) v16.1.1+

## Installation

This module uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage dependencies and run scripts for development.

To install as an application dependency:
```
$ yarn add gadgets
```

To build the app and run all tests:
```
$ yarn run all
```

To build and run the demo application in electron use:
```
$ yarn run demo
```
This will check out all dependencies, build the code, test, and then try to run it within electron.  This will take some time to complete.

To just attempt to run the application without building use (assuming the app was recently built):
```
$ yarn start
```

To change the code while electron is running and use `CMD + R` to refresh electron:
```
# yarn run watch
```


This library was created for use in the [Electron UI](
https://electron.atom.io/) and has been tested to work with the most recent version of Chromium in Electron.  It contains a custom set of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) widgets and composite components used to create a desktop application.  The build uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Wepback](https://webpack.github.io/) to create the package.  Once built it contains a distribution bundle (`bundle.js`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`) that can be included within another project.  The library also makes use of [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

Click on the each documented element below to see a picture of the component (where applicable).  To see a live demo, build the application (listed above).  It will run a demo electron application demonstrating each component.  The demo application also contains samples that demonstrate how the components are used.

## Usage

The CSS styles must be included within a project using CSS modules or via webpack configuration:

#### code snippet
```javascript
const styles = require('gadgets/dist/styles.css');

import {
	Button,
	ButtonToggle
} from 'gadgets';

...

<Button />
<ButtonToggle />
```

#### webpack snippet
```javascript
module.exports = {
	entry: [
		path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'gadgets', 'dist', 'styles.css'),
	],
	target: 'node',
	output: {
		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
		filename: 'bundle.js',
		publicPath: "dist/",
		libraryTarget: "commonjs"
	},
    ...
```

This will give a webpack module an **entry** point to copy the gadgets CSS file into that build's distribution.  Without this the built in styles for each control will be missing.

Note that React is NOT packaged with the app.  An app that uses this library must supply the React library.  The demo application shows an example of this.


## Widgets
The module contains the following widgets (click on each header to see attribute/event details for each):

### [Accordion](docs/lib/accordion/Accordion.md)/[AccordionItem](docs/lib/accordion/AccordionItem.md)
An accordion control contains N number of AccordionItems.  These items will display/hide the contents of that item when the header of that item is clicked.  The content of an AccordionItem can be any set of HTML tags.  The demo application shows a List embedded within the accordion.

### [Badge](docs/lib/badge/Badge.md)
A counter widget that annotates (overlays) another widget.

### [BaseProps](docs/lib/shared/props.md)
This module represents the properties that are shared by every class in the project.  This includes properties such as color, id, disabled, etc.

### [Breadcrumbs](docs/lib/breadcrumbs/Breadcrumbs.md)
A navigation control used to keep track of previous locations visited.  The rightmost item is the current location.  This provides a "path" back to the start of some navigation.

A circular button control.  Works like a typical button... except it's a circle.

### [Triangle](docs/lib/triangle/Triangle.md)
Uses SVG to draw a triangle within the container.

### [Wrapper](docs/lib/shared/wrapper.md)
Each component uses the Wrapper component to catch potential errors within the control.  These are [error boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) that are new to React 16.  It also wraps the [ThemeProvider](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider) used by the [styled-components](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html).

## Styles

The library contains an external style sheet that must be included.  It is located in `node_modules/gadgets/dist/styles.css`.  This library also uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).  If the `Editor` control is used, then the highlight CSS files need to be included as well.  They are located in `node_modules/gadgets/dist/highlights/*.css`.  These should be copied to the root of the site/app (with something like the [Copy Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin)).
