## Tab
Represents a single `Tab` entry within a `TabContainer`.  This componentwould generally be used only with the `TabContainer`.  The tab actsas a wrapper for some other content (the children within the control canbe any other object).## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/tabs.png" width="50%" />## Examples:```javascriptimport {Tab, TabContainer} from 'gadgets';<TabContainer maxTabs={3} location={Location.bottom} nonavigation>    <Tab title="tab #1">#1<br/><br/>{randomText}</Tab>    <Tab title="tab #2">#2<br/><br/>{randomText}</Tab>    <Tab title="tab #3">#3<br/><br/>{randomText}</Tab>    <Tab title="tab #4">#4<br/><br/>{randomText}</Tab></TabContainer>```This example will create a tab container with four tabs drawn on thebottom of the control.  It will suppress the navigation buttons.This example sets the max number of tabs to 3, so the fourth wouldbe suppressed.The tab contents in this example hold a string, but could hold any othervalid HTML objects.## API#### Events- `onClick` - invoked when a tab is selected from the Container- `onClose` - invoked when the close button is selected on the tab.  Areference to the closed tab is passed to the callback.#### Styles- `ui-tab` - The global CSS class applied to the top level `div` of the`Tab` component.#### Properties- `href: {any}` - This is a general object used to pass references fromthe parent to the child.  It includes the following attributes:  - `selectHandler` - a function reference back to the container that is    invoked to tell the container that this tab was selected.- `orientation` - the location in the container component where thetab will be drawn (top, bottom, left, right)- `selected: {boolean} (false)` - if this is set to true, then the tabwill show as selected.- `title: {string} ('')` - the text that will be shown on the tab.
