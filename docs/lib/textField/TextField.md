## TextField
The TextField is a wrapper component for the built in `<input>` tag.  Thiscontrol allows the user to add validation routines to the input controlbeyond the builtin routines.Validations are creation by creating an instance of the `Validator` class andimplementing a validation funtion, failure message, and success message.Validation is NOT used by default.  It must be declared with a prop named`usevalidation.  The control has five built in validation routines (definedin validator.ts):- max length (when used with the "max" parameter)- min length (when used with the "min" parameter)- email- url- regex## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/textField.png" width="50%" />## Examples:##### Simple```javascriptimport {TextField} from 'gadgets';<TextField placeholder="simple" />```This will create a standard input text box with no validation.##### Max/Min validator```javascriptimport {TextField} from 'gadgets';<TextField    placeholder="min/max validation"    minLength="5"    maxLength="10"    usevalidation/>```This will create an input control that uses validation.  It will check thewidth of the string to fall within the min/max range.  When the string isoutside of the validation range the red *error* message value will be usedtoo display a message below the control.  When it is within range a green*success* message will be printed below.##### Custom validator```javascriptimport {TextField, Validator} from 'gadgets';<TextField    placeholder="custom"    usevalidation    validators={[        new Validator(            (value: string) => {                return /^[0-9a-zA-Z]+$/.test(value);            },            'Not alphanumeric only',            'Contains only alphanumeric'        )    ]}/>```This will create a control with a custom alphanumeric validation routine.## API#### Events- `onBlur` - Invoked when focus on control is lost.- `onChange` - Invoked each time a key is pressed.  The validation routine isalso called with each key.- `onKeyDown` - Invoked when a key is pressed.  The escape key is checkedand if pressed the input is reverted to its previous setting.- `onKeyPress` - Invoked when a key pressed.  When the "Enter" key is pressedvalidation is performed and the `onValidation` routine is invoked and theresults of the validation are sent to the callback.- `onValidation(flag: boolean)` - When enter is pressed this routine iscalled.  If validation passes, then true is given to the callback.#### Styles- `ui-textfield` - Placed on the `<div>` used to wrap the `<input>` field.#### Properties- `disabled: {boolean} (false)` - When true, the control is disabled- `id: {string} ('')` - The CSS id for this control- `noborder: {boolean} (false)` - Turns off the border around the component- `sizing: {Sizing} (Sizing.normal) - The font size for the control (seethe Sizing class in shared).- `type: {string} ('text')` - The type of input control.  This is the typedefined by the [HTML input tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).- `useclear {boolean} (false)` - When used it presents a circle "x" buttonthat will clear the current input from the control and set the focus tothe input.- `usevalidation: {boolean} (false)` - If this is true then the validationroutines are exectued.- `validators: {Validator[]} ([])` - A list of Validator classes.  Each of theclasses in this list are used against the input to check if it passes therules set in that validator function.- `visible: {boolean} (true)` - If set to false this control is hidden (setto a display of none).
