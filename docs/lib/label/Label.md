## Label
A text label string control that can be edited.  The label can be doubleclicked to enter editint mode (similar to a text field).  This behavior canalso be suppressed to make the text static.  The contorl is a `<span>`element surrounding text.## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/label.png" width="30%" />## Examples:```javascriptimport {Label} from 'gadgets';<Label    focus    text="label text"/>```## API#### Events- `onBlur` - Invoked when the focus moves away from the label- `onChange(val: string)` - Invoked when a label is changed.  This happenswhen editing the control and pressing enter or losing focus (blur).- `onClick` - Invoked when the label is clicked.- `onDoubleClick` - Invoked when the user double clicks on the control.  Thiswill cause the control to enter an editing mode.- `onKeyDown` - Invoked when a key is initially pressed.  This captures the"escape" key and reverts the text to its previous state if in edit mode.- `onKeyPress' - Invoked when a key is pressed.  This captures the "Enter"key to commit a user edit to the text of the control if editing.- onUpdate(previous: string, text: string)` - Invoked when the label ischanged from one value to another.  The previous text and new text are passedto the callback.#### Styles- `ui-label` - Applied to the surrounding `<span>` element for all labels#### Properties- `focus: {boolean} (false)` - If true, then this control is given the focus- `noedit: {boolean} (false)` - If true, then the control can't be edited- `text: {string} ('')` - the text value associated with the label.- `useedit: {string} ('')` - If true, then the control is initially placed inedit mode.
