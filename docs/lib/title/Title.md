## Title
A reusable title block used to format two items: a title and
a widget.  The title is generally a text string and the widget
can be a text string or another control.  The control takes these
two items and presents them in one of four layouts controled by
the enum `TitleLayout`:

- TitleLayout.quarter
- TitleLayout.even
- TitleLayout.threequarter
- TitleLayout.third
- TitleLayout.stacked
- TitleLayout.dominant
- TitleLayout.none

In `quarter` the title takes up 25% and the widget takes up 75%
In `even` the title and widget take up 50%
In `threequarter` the title takes up 75% and the widget takes up 25%
In `third` the titel takes up 33% of the space
In `stacked` the title is placed above the widget
In `dominant` the title takes up 83% of the width (5/6)
In `none` the title takes up 100% of the width
