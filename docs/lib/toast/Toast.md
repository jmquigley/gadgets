## Toast
A popup that contains a message on the top or bottom of that container.The message will disapper after N seconds.  Contains an X button to removesooner if the user desires.  A toast can also be persistent and then itwill only disappear when the user clicks the close button.It contains four basic modes:- info- warning- error- customFor this to work properly the container holding this control must have aposition of "relative".  The control relies on absolute positioning so theparent needs to be relative for it to work.## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/toast.png" width="50%" />## Examples:```javascriptimport {Toast, ToastLevel} from 'gadgets';<Toast    decay={true}    level={ToastLevel.info}>    This is a sample info message</Toast>``````javascriptimport {Toast, ToastLevel} from 'gadgets';<Toast    decay={false}    level={ToastLevel.custom}    style={{        backgroundColor="#7fbf3f"        borderColor="#3fbfbf"        color="magenta"    }}>    This is a sample custom message</Toast>```## API#### Events- `onClick()` - If the user clicks the close button this event is invoked.- `onClose()` - when the message is closed or disappers this callback isinvoked.  It takes no parameters.#### Styles- `ui-toast` - second level style placed on the content `<div>`.#### Properties- `bottom {boolean} (false)` - If this is true, then the message will bedrawn at the bottom of the container where the message generated,otherwise the message is written to the top of the container.- `decay {boolean} (true)` - There are two types of Toast messages: decay andpersistent.  The decay type, when this property is true, will automaticallydisapper after *duration*  seconds.  The persistent type will stay withinthe container until the user presses the close button (X).- `duration {number} (3)` - The number of seconds the message will appear whenusing a message type of *decay* (see type below). e.g. "5" = five seconds.- `level {ToastLevel} (ToastLevel.info)` - The logging level of message thatwill be printed.  This works like log4js levels and contains four basictypes: info, warning, error, and custom.  Each type has a special color schemeassociated with it (info is blue, warning is yellow, error is red).  An enumerationnamed `ToastLevel` holds the value for each type (ToastLevel.info,ToastLevel.warning, ToastLevel.error, ToastLevel.custom).
