## Breadcrumbs
A navigation control used to keep track of previous locations visited.  Therightmost item is the current location.  This provides a "path" back to thestart of some navigation (i.e. trail of bread crumbs).This is a traditional widget control, in that it responds to new props anddoes not maintain the path of breadcrumbs.  An event is used to inform theuser that one was selected.  Rebuilding the path is up to the applicationusing the control.## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/breadcrumbs.png" width="50%" />## Examples:```javascriptimport {Breadcrumbs} from 'gadgets';<Breadcrumbs    chevron="arrow-right"    icon="pied-piper"    items={[        {name: 'name1', uri: 'http://www.example1.com'},        {name: 'name2', uri: 'http://www.example2.com'},        {name: 'name3', uri: 'http://www.example3.com'}]    }]    onSelect={(name: string, uri: string) => {        debug('selected => name: %s, uri: %s', name, uri);    }}/>```## API#### Events- `onSelect(name: string, uri: string)` - When an item is selected thiscallback is invoked.#### Styles- `ui-breadcrumbs` - Applied to the `<div>` container around the Component- `ui-breadcrumbs-name` - Each path/name in the component has this selector.The underlying control is a ButtonText widget.- `ui-breadcrumbs-chevron` - the path separater is an Icon component betweeneach path ButtonText.- `ui-breadcrumbs-icon` - A Icon is placed at the front of the control bydefault.  This is used to style that first icon.#### Properties- `chevron: {string} ('chevron-right)` - The font awesome icon used as adivider between path elements in the component.- `icon: {string} ('paperclip')` - The font awesome icon placed at thefront of the component path list.- `items: {Crumbs[]} ([])` - An array of name/uri pairs that represent thepath locations that will be displayed.  They are displayed in the orderof the array.  The data type is a Crumbs interface that contains name (asas string) and uri (as a string).- `noicon {boolean} (false)` - Suppresses the icon on the front of thelist when true.
