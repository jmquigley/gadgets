## Button
A typical button control widget.  This control only uses an icon and no text to represent the button.The icons are [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) strings.  That library is built into this module,so any font available in the current release of that library is available.#### Examples:```javascriptimport {Button} from 'gadgets';<Button iconName="cab" onClick={someFunction} />```#### Events- `onClick`` - when the button control is clicked by the user#### Styles- `ui-button` - top level style placed on `<i>` control that constructs the button.#### Properties- `classes: string[]` - an array of strings that represent custom CSS class names that will be appliedto the component.- `disabled: boolean` - if true then then the control is disabled.  Defaults to false.- iconName: string` - the name of the font awesome icon used with this button- `noripple: boolean` - turns off the ripple effect for a button.  On by default.- `style: object` - an object of key value/pairs that represent CSS style settings- `visible: boolean` - turns the display of this control on or off.  If true, then the component canbe seen.  The default is true.
