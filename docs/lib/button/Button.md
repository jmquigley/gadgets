<a name="module_Button"></a>

## Button
A typical button control widget.  This control only uses an icon and no text

strings.  That library is built into this module, so any font available in
the current release of that library is available.

#### Examples:

```javascript
import {Button} from 'gadgets';
<Button iconName="cab" onClick={someFunction} />
```

#### Events
- `onClick()` - when the button control is clicked by the user

#### Styles
- `ui-button` - top level style placed on `<i>` control that constructs the
button.

#### Properties
- iconName: string` - the name of the font awesome icon used with this button
