## Wrapper
This component surrounds (wraps) all other components in the library.  Itis used to catch potential errors within the control.  These are [error boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)that are new to React 16.  It also wraps the [ThemeProvider](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider)used by the [styled-components](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html).## Screen:#### Before<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/wrapper-before.png" width="50%" />#### After<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/wrapper-after.png" width="50%" />## Examples:```javascriptimport {Wrapper} from 'gadgets';<Wrapper    className="test-class"    onError={(error, errorInfo) => {        console.log(error, errorInfo);    }    reset>    <BuggyComponent /></Wrapper>```In this example if the `<BuggyComponent>` throws an error, then this Wrapperwill catch the error and present a fallback component that prevents Reactfrom crashing the rest of the app/components.## API#### Events- `onError(error: any, errorInfo: any)` - When an error is captured by theReact `componentDidCatch` method and handled, this callback is also invokedso that the user can respond outside of this control.#### Styles- `ui-error` - The top level `<div>` control around the error block.- `ui-error-message` - A `<span>` around the error message from the Errorthrown from the component.- `ui-error-stack` -  A `<details>` block that contains the stack trace ofthe thrown Error.#### Properties- `children: {React.ReactNode} (null)` - The underlying components that aresurrounded by this wrapper.- `err: {any} (null)` - A custom react component that can be used as theerror output.  This is used to override the default error output.- `reset: {boolean} (false)` - After a component is wrapped, and an error isthrown, the state of *error* will be permanent within the component.  Passingreset as a prop to the wrapper allows the Error condition to be reset.  Thiswould be used if there is a facility in place within the component toreact/retry conditions that lead to fixed component.  Without this reset itwould be impossible to reset the internal state of the wrapper on retry.
