## BaseProps
The following properties are shared by all components in the library#### PropertiesThe following are the properties on the BaseProps object used by mostcomponents.- `className: {string} ('')` - the global classname string that will be appliedto the given component- `contentEditable: boolean (false)` - this will make the control editable.  Thisis used in controls like the Label to allow changing the string contents.- `direction`- `disabled: boolean (false)` - if true then then the control is disabled.- `errorMessage {string} ('')` - An error message that is passed into thecomponent.- `focus {boolean} (false)` - if true, the component has the focus.  This isnot used on all components.- `id: string ('')` - the CSS id field.  This is used to uniquely identify acomponent (for CSS)- `location: Location (Location.none)` - Sets the positional location style for acontrol (see the Location enumeration below).- `noedit: boolean (false)` - When this is set the contents of the control can't bechanged.- `nohover: boolean (false)` - Controls that use a hover can use the nohover toturn off that function.- `noripple: boolean (false)` - turns off the ripple effect for a button.- `obj {string} ('Unknown')` - a string that names a component.  We can't use theclass name to represent the name of a component because it is lost when the appis minified.  This is used to preserve the name of the component in props.- `selected: boolean (false)` - if true, then this component was selected via amouse click (such as the ListItem).  If false, then it was not clicked.- `sizing: Sizing (Sizing.normal)` - The component sizing for the control.  It isset to `Sizing.normal` by default which represents 1.0em.- `style: object ({})` - an object of key value/pairs that represent CSS stylesettings- `testing {boolean} (false)` - if set to true, then the component is being usedunder test.  Some components will generate unique UUID values that will differon each execution of the program.  This can be used in cases where a stable, deterministicid is needed.- `visible: boolean (true)` - turns the display of this control on or off.  If true,then the component can be seen.#### Enumerations##### Direction- up- down- left- right##### Location- none- topLeft- top- topRight- middleLeft- middle- middleRight- bottomLeft- bottom- bottomRight
