## AccordionItem
Generates elements that will be contained within the Accordion.  Thiswill resolve to an `<li>` tag.  It represents each individual itemwithin the accordion.  It is the container for the content.  It canalso be thought of as a container for content.The `AccordionItem` represet a clickable header within this control.It is derived from the ListItem/Item control, so it can havebuttons on the left/right side of title text.#### Examples:```javascriptimport {Accordion, AccordionItem} from 'gadgets';<Accordion>    <AccordionItem        initialToggle={true}        rightButton={<Button iconName="car" />}        title="Accordion Item #1"    >    ...    </AccordionItem>    <AccordionItem title="Accordion Item #2">...</AccordionItem></Accordion>```This example would create an accordion control with two items.  The firstitem would be expanded by default and contain a right button control.#### Events- `onClick(toggleState)` - This callback is invoked when the headerportion of the AccordionItem is clicked.  It is given the currentstate of the toggle (true if visible, otherwise false)#### Styles- `ui-accordionitem` - The top level style for the Item on the outer `<div>`- `ui-accordion-content` - Style applied to the content under the AccordionItem.This exists around the inner `<div>`#### Properties- `initialToggle: boolean` - The initial state of the content.  If true, thenthe content is shown, otherwise it is hidden.  Set initially to false.- `leftButton: Button (null)` - An instance of a button control placed to theleft of the title.- `rightButton: Button (null)` - An instance of a button control placed to theright of the title.
