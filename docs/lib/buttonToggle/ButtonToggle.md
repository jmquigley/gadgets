## ButtonToggle
A button control that switches between the given icons when clicked.There are two forms for this component: controlled and uncontrolled.The default process is controlled.  This means that the component willmaintain the internal toggled state of the command.  When the propertycontrolled is set to false, then the toggle state is managed by thegiven *selected* property.  This property is ignored when thecomponent is controlled.On each click the `onClick` callback is invoked and given the currentstate.## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/buttons-icons.png" width="70%" />## Examples:#### Controlled (default)```javascriptimport {ButtonToggle} from 'gadgets';<ButtonToggle    iconNameOn="star"    iconNameOff="star-o"    fgColorOn="red"    fgColorOff="blue"    sizing={Sizing.normal}    onClick={somefunction}/>```#### Uncontrolled```javascriptimport {ButtonToggle} from 'gadgets';<ButtonToggle    controlled={false}    iconNameOn="star"    iconNameOff="star-o"    fgColorOn="red"    fgColorOff="blue"    selected={true}    sizing={Sizing.normal}    onClick={somefunction}/>```#### Events- `onclick(toggle: boolean)` - When the button is clicked, then thebutton toggle is changed.  This callback returns the current stateof the toggle.  True is on, false is off.#### Styles- `ui-button-toggle` - Style applied to the `<i>` button control.#### Properties- `bgColorOff: {string} ('inherit')` - The background color when thebutton is in the off position.- `bgColorOn: {string} ('inherit')` - The background color when thebutton is in the on position- `fgColorOff: {string} ('gray')` - The foreground color when thebutton is in the off position- `fgColorOn: {string} ('black')` - the foreground color when thebutton is in the on position- `iconNameOff: {string} ('bomb')` - the name of the font awesome iconassociated with the button when it is off.- `iconNameOn: {string} ('bomb')` - the name of the font awesome iconassociated with the button when it is on.- `initialToggle: {boolean} (false)` - the initial state of the buttonThis is different than selected, as it is only used when the buttonis created.
