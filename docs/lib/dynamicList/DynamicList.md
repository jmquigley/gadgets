## DynamicList
The `DynamicList` control is a specialized List control that can bemanipulated by the user.  They can add/remove/select items from it.  Thecontrol takes an initial list to seed the control, but then items can bedynamically added/removed.Some of the features include:- Add new items with the "+" button- Sort the list in ascending/descending order- Incrementally search for items- List is divided into pages for performanceThis is not a typical control.  It is a composite control that managesits own state.  Typically one would inject all data via props, but thiscontrol does not do that.  It takes an initial list of input to createthe list, but then it manages the data from that point.  This means thatas data is added to the control it notifies add/delete behavior viacallbacks (onNew/onDelete).  This presents a challenge in that it's apush UI control.  Let's say an item is added to the list and the callbackis invoked.  The receiver of the callback must do something with thisdata.  Lets say what the user does with the data fails.  Now the controland the external data are out of sync.  The control may show the databut the external process didnt' save it.  That poses a problem; how toshow errors.The control handles this item above with two exposed calls: `handleError`and `handleDelete`.  The `handleError` takes a string error message.  Whencalled a `Toast` will appear with an error message and it will decay.the `handleDelete` can be called to remove the item.  This is done via a*ref* to the control.## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/dynamicList.png" width="60%" />## Examples:#### Simple```javascriptimport {DynamicList} from 'gadgets';<DynamicList    items={{        title1: widget1        title2: widget2        title1: widget3    }}    onDelete={(title: string) => {        console.log(`Deleting item from list: ${title}`);    }}    onNew={(title: string) => {        console.log(`Adding new item to list: ${title}`);    }}    onSelect={(title: string) => {        console.log(`Selected item: ${title}`);    }}    pageSizes={[10, 20, 30]}    title="Dynamic List Test"/>```#### With Error Handling```javascriptimport {DynamicList} from 'gadgets';const dlref: any = null;<DynamicList    items={{        title1: widget1        title2: widget2        title1: widget3    }}    pageSizes={[10, 20, 30]}    ref={ref => dlref = ref}    title="Dynamic List Test"/>dlref.handleError('Show this error message');```## API#### Events- `onBlur` - Invoked when a list item control loses focus.- `onClick` - Invoked when a list item is clicked.- `onDelete(title: string)` - This event is executed when an item is removedfrom the list.- `onFocus` - Invoked when a list item is clicked.- `onNew(title: string)` - This event is executed when an item is added tothe list.  The title of the new item is a parameter to the callback- `onSelect(title: string)` - Invoked when a list item is selected. The titleof the selected item is a parameter to the callback.- `onSort(sortOrder: SortOrder)` - Invoked whne the list is sorted.  It willgive the selected order to the callback.- `onUpdate(previous: string, title: string)` - When an item is renamed thiscallback is invoked.  The previous value and the new title are passed to thecallback#### Styles- `ui-dynamiclist` - applied to the `div` accordion control that holds thelist.- `ui-dynamiclist-container` - applied to the top level container `div` thatsurrounds the list and the *toast* for error message handling.#### Properties- `items: DynamicListItem ({}}` - An object that holds unique title andwidgets in the format `{[title]: widget}`.  Each item in the Objectrepresents a list item.  This is used to seed the control at creation.- `layout: TitleLayout (TitleLayout.dominant)` - How the title/widgetwill be displayed in the list item (seee the Title control).- `nocollapse: boolean (false)` - Determines if the list can be"rolled up" when the header is clicked.  The default behavior is toallow.  IF this is set to false, then the list can't be collapsed.- `pageSizes: number[] ([25, 50, 100])` - A list of page number sizes thatcan be used by the pager.  It is used against the total items todetermine the total number of pages in the control display.- `sortOrder: SortOrder (SortOrder.ascending)` - The list sort order.  Canbe either ascending or descending.- `title: string ('')` - This string value is in the header of the control.
