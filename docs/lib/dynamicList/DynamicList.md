## DynamicList
The `DynamicList` control is a specialized List control that can bemanipulated by the user.  They can add/remove/select items from it.  Thecontrol takes an initial list to seed the control, but then items can bedynamically added/removed.Some of the features include:- Add new items with the "+" button- Sort the list in ascending/descending order- Incrementally search for items- List is divided into pages for performance## Screen:<img src="https://github.com/jmquigley/gadgets/blob/master/images/dynamicList.png" width="60%" />## Examples:```javascriptimport {DynamicList} from 'gadgets';<DynamicList    items={{        title1: widget1        title2: widget2        title1: widget3    }}    onDelete={(title: string) => {        console.log(`Deleting item from list: ${title}`);    }}    onNew={(title: string) => {        console.log(`Adding new item to list: ${title}`);    }}    onSelect={(title: string) => {        console.log(`Selected item: ${title}`);    }}    pageSizes={[10, 20, 30]}    title="Dynamic List Test"/>```## API#### Events- `onBlur` - Invoked when a list item control loses focus.- `onClick` - Invoked when a list item is clicked.- `onDelete(title: string)` - This event is executed when an item is removedfrom the list.- `onFocus` - Invoked when a list item is clicked.- `onNew(title: string)` - This event is executed when an item is added tothe list.  The title of the new item is a parameter to the callback- `onSelect(title: string)` - Invoked when a list item is selected. The titleof the selected item is a parameter to the callback.- `onSort(sortOrder: SortOrder)` - Invoked whne the list is sorted.  It willgive the selected order to the callback.- `onUpdate(previous: string, title: string)` - When an item is renamed thiscallback is invoked.

Each item in the Objectrepresents a list item.  This is used to seed the control at creation.- `layout: TitleLayout (TitleLayout.dominant)` - How the title/widgetwill be displayed in the list item (seee the Title control).- `nocollapse: boolean (false)` - Determines if the list can be"rolled up" when the header is clicked.  The default behavior is toallow.  IF this is set to false, then the list can't be collapsed.- `pageSizes: number[] ([25, 50, 100])` - A list of page number sizes thatcan be used by the pager.  It is used against the total items todetermine the total number of pages in the control display.- `sortOrder: SortOrder (SortOrder.ascending)` - The list sort order.
