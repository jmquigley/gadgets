	The library code for gadgets that is built into a bundle excludes React and
	ReactDOM. That means that the app is responsible for including the library.  Since
	this demo is in the same directory as the library you CANNOT have a node_modules
	library here.  Having that directory, with React in it, will cause a multiple inclusion
	problem and place the app into this ref hell "react refs must have owner".
